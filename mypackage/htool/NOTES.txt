hmatrix -> policy-based design (strategy pattern compile time variant) with LowRankMatrix ; shared ressource with a shared pointer with cluster tree
LowRankMatrix -> Abstract Base Class (ABC) for new "policies"
IMatrix -> runtime polymorphism, we could use CRTP to do static polymorphism, but is it worth it ?
