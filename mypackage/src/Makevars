## With R 3.1.0 or later, you can uncomment the following line to tell R to 
## enable compilation with C++11 (where available)
##
## Also, OpenMP support in Armadillo prefers C++11 support. However, for wider
## availability of the package we do not yet enforce this here.  It is however
## recommended for client packages to set it.
##
## And with R 3.4.0, and RcppArmadillo 0.7.960.*, we turn C++11 on as OpenMP
## support within Armadillo prefers / requires it
CXX_STD = CXX11
